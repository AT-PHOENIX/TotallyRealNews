      <p>Russian troops are accused of massacring hundreds of civilians there, shocking the world and prompting allegations of war crimes.

        AFP's bureau chief in The Hague, Danny Kemp, was part of the team that uncovered the atrocities on April 2, 2022. Here is his account of what they saw that day, originally published on AFP's Correspondent blog site.
        
        Some may find the account distressing.
        
        We saw three of them at first, lying in the dirt like piles of rags. That alone would have been bad enough.
        
        "Bodies," someone in the car said, because it was all that could be said. Our driver screeched to a halt and we jumped out of the vehicle.
        
        A long grey road on the edge of Bucha stretched out under an equally grey Ukrainian sky. The three bodies lay next to a stack of construction materials and wooden pallets.
        
        As we approached we could see that one had his hands tied behind his back.
        
        Yet it seemed to take a while before any of us -- myself, photographer Ronaldo Schemidt, video journalist Nicolas Garcia, along with our fixer, our driver and our security consultant -- actually looked up and down the rest of the street.
        
        When we did, we realised that these three bodies were only the beginning. Dotted here and there, for as far as we could see in either direction, were more, many more. Corpse after corpse after corpse along this single debris-strewn street.
        
        This lonely place had become a special kind of hell for the inhabitants of Bucha.
        
        A wave of shock and disbelief washed over me: this horrible scene could not be real. But it was. I looked at my colleagues, and that was when the professional instinct kicked in, helped by the robotic tiredness at the end of a three-week stint in Ukraine.
        
        We began to work, because we knew that this was a huge story, one that could possibly lead to allegations of war crimes.
        
        We knew that as journalists we had to tell the world about it, and quickly. Ronaldo and Nicolas were taking images, the evidence to prove that the reports on social media about bodies in Bucha were true. I set about counting them.
        
        We knew, too, how fast disinformation campaigns about such incidents can spread (and later so it proved), and how important it was to get everything right.
        
        What we did not know was that within 24 hours, the images and the text we would produce would spark international outrage against Russia, and calls for sanctions that moved the war in Ukraine into a new and more distressing phase.The images of civilians killed in Bucha have shocked the world. 
        The Russian government and pro-Russian accounts claim they were staged and that some bodies were moving. </p>
